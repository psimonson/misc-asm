=           Miscellaneous Assembler             =
=================================================
To compile and assemble for MS-DOS or dosbox.
# make
To compile and copy into ${HOME}/dos type for
dosbox.
# make copy
=================================================
=               dosbox startup                  =
=================================================
[autoexec]
@mount c /home/<username>/dos
=================================================
NOTE: Enter your user name in place of <username>
or you will get an error from dosbox.
=================================================
=                 Run dosbox                    =
=================================================
Finally type this to run dosbox.
# dosbox
In dosbox type:
C:\>C: [Return]
C:\>fun-fun10 [Return]
=================================================
NOTE: The hyphen means enter fun through fun9.
That will run a program. Just in-case you didn't
know how to use dosbox.
